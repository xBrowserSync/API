xBrowserSync is a free tool for syncing browser data between different browsers and devices, built for privacy and anonymity. For full details, see [www.xbrowsersync.org](https://www.xbrowsersync.org/).

This repository contains the source code for the REST service API that client applications communicate with. If you'd like to run your own xBrowserSync service on your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) web server, follow the installation steps below.

Once configured, you can begin syncing your browser data to your xBrowserSync service, and if you're feeling generous, [allow others to sync their data to your service](https://www.xbrowsersync.org/#getinvolved) also!

## Running with Docker

The easiest way to get up and running is by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run the xBrowserSync API as a container. Docker is a popular container management and imaging platform that allows you to quickly work with containers on Linux and Windows.

Once you have installed Docker you can use the [xBrowserSync API Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/xbrowsersync/api) to get a production-ready xBrowserSync service up and running with minimal effort (view the [README](https://github.com/xbrowsersync/api-docker/blob/master/README.md) for more information).

## Manual installation

Whilst running in a Docker container is the recommended way to run your xBrowserSync service, you can 

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### 1. Clone the xBrowserSync API source repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/xbrowsersync/api.git

### 2. Install and build xBrowserSync API package

  (Use the `unsafe-perm` flag if you get any permissions issues whilst trying to install):

    $ npm install --unsafe-perm

### 3. Configure MongoDB databases

  1. Run the following commands in the mongo shell:
  
      (Replace `[password]` with a cleartext password of your choice; however, do not use any of the following special characters: `: # ? / \ %`, or the application will fail to connect to mongo with the following error: `failed to connect to server [xbrowsersyncdb:27017] on first connect [MongoNetworkError: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND xbrowsersyncdb xbrowsersyncdb:27017]`)

      ```
      use admin
      db.createUser({ user: "xbrowsersyncdb", pwd: "[password]", roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "xbrowsersync" }, { role: "readWrite", db: "xbrowsersynctest" } ] })
      use xbrowsersync
      db.newsynclogs.createIndex( { "expiresAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 } )
      db.newsynclogs.createIndex({ "ipAddress": 1 })
      ```

  2. Add the following environment variables to hold xBrowserSync DB account username and password:

      - `XBROWSERSYNC_DB_USER`
      - `XBROWSERSYNC_DB_PWD`

      On Windows, open a Command Prompt and type (replacing `[password]` with the password entered in the mongo shell):
  
      ```
      setx XBROWSERSYNC_DB_USER "xbrowsersyncdb"
      setx XBROWSERSYNC_DB_PWD "[password]"
      ```
  
      On Ubuntu/Debian Linux, open a terminal emulator and type:
      
      ```
      $ pico ~/.profile
      ```
      
      Add the lines (replacing `[password]` with the password entered in the mongo shell):
      
      ```
      export XBROWSERSYNC_DB_USER=xbrowsersyncdb
      export XBROWSERSYNC_DB_PWD=[password]
      ```
      
      Save and exit, then log out and back in again.

  #### If exposing your service to the public it is recommended you also perform the following steps:
  
  3. Add a TTL index on `bookmarks.lastAccessed` to delete syncs that have not been accessed for 3 weeks:
   
      ```
      use xbrowsersync
      db.bookmarks.createIndex( { "lastAccessed": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 21*86400 } )
      ```

### 4. Modify configuration settings

The file `config/settings.default.json` contains all of the default configuration settings. User configuration values should be stored in `config/settings.json` and will override the defaults. Should you wish to change any of the configuration settings, copy `settings.default.json` and rename the copy to `settings.json` before changing any values as required. Be sure to remove any settings that have not been changed so that any amendments to the default values in future versions are picked up. For example, a basic user configuration to modify the service status message could look like:

```
{
  "status": {
    "message": "Welcome to my xBrowserSync service!"
  }
}
```

Any changes to the user configuration will require the service to be restarted before being picked up. The available configuration settings are:

Config Setting | Description | Default Value
-------------- | ----------- | -------------
`allowedOrigins` | Array of origins permitted to access the service. Each origin can be a `String` or a `RegExp`. For example `[ 'http://example1.com', /\.example2\.com$/ ]` will accept any request from `http://example1.com` or from a subdomain of `example2.com`. If the array is empty, all origins are permitted | `[]` (All origins permitted)
`dailyNewSyncsLimit` | The maximum number of new syncs that a single IP address can create per day. If this setting is enabled, logs are created in newsynclogs collection to track IP addresses (cleared the following day). Set as `0` to disable. | `3`
`db.authSource` | The database to use for authentication. | `admin`
`db.connTimeout` | The connection timeout period to use for MongoDB. Using a high value helps prevent dropped connections in a hosted environment. | `30000` (30 secs)
`db.host` | The MongoDB server address to connect to, either a hostname, IP address, or UNIX domain socket. | `127.0.0.1`
`db.name` | Name of the MongoDB database to use. | `xbrowsersync`
`db.username` | Username of the account used to access MongoDB. Set as empty string to use environment variable `XBROWSERSYNC_DB_USER`. | (Empty string, defers to environment variable)
`db.password` | Password of the account used to access MongoDB. Set as empty string to use environment variable `XBROWSERSYNC_DB_PWD`. | (Empty string, defers to environment variable)
`db.port` | The port to use to connect to MongoDB. | `27017`
`log.file.enabled` | If set to true, [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) will be used to capture minimal logging (service start/stop, new sync created, errors) to file. Logged messages are output to `log.file.path` and the log file is rotated automatically each period set by `log.file.rotationPeriod`, resulting in files "`log.file.path`.0", "`log.file.path`.1", etc. | `true`
`log.file.level` | Bunyan log level to capture: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`. | `info`
`log.file.path` | File path to log messages to (ensure the account node is running as has permission to write to this location). | `/var/log/xBrowserSync/api.log`
`log.file.rotatedFilesToKeep` | Maximum number of rotated log files to retain. | `5`
`log.file.rotationPeriod` | 	The period at which to rotate log files. This is a string of the format "$number$scope" where "$scope" is one of "ms" (milliseconds -- only useful for testing), "h" (hours), "d" (days), "w" (weeks), "m" (months), "y" (years). Or one of the following names can be used "hourly" (means 1h), "daily" (1d), "weekly" (1w), "monthly" (1m), "yearly" (1y). Rotation is done at the start of the scope: top of the hour (h), midnight (d), start of Sunday (w), start of the 1st of the month (m), start of Jan 1st (y). | `1d`
`log.stdout.enabled` | If set to true, [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) will be used to capture minimal logging (service start/stop, new sync created, errors) to stdout. | `true`
`log.stdout.level` | Bunyan log level to capture: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`. | `info`
`maxSyncs` | The maximum number of unique syncs to be stored on the service, once this limit is reached no more new syncs are permitted. Esers with an existing sync ID are able to get and update their sync data as normal. This value multiplied by the maxSyncSize will determine the maximum amount of disk space used by the xBrowserSync service. Set as `0` to disable. | `5242`
`maxSyncSize` | The maximum sync size in bytes. Note this is not equivalent to the size/amount of bookmarks as data is compressed and encrypted client-side before being sent to the service. | `512000` (500kb)
`server.behindProxy` | Set to `true` if service is behind a proxy, client IP address will be set from [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) header. Important: Do not set to `true` unless a proxy is present otherwise client IP address can easily be spoofed by malicious users. | `false`
`server.host` | Host name or IP address to use for Node.js server for accepting incoming connections. | `127.0.0.1`
`server.https.certPath` | Path to a valid SSL certificate. Required when HTTPS is enabled. | (Empty string, no path set)
`server.https.enabled` | If enabled, the service is started using HTTPS. | `false`
`server.https.keyPath` | Path to the SSL certificate's private key. Required when HTTPS is enabled. | (Empty string, no path set)
`server.port` | Port to use for Node.js server for accepting incoming connections. | `8080`
`status.allowNewSyncs` | Determines whether users will be allowed to create new syncs on this server. Note: if this setting is set to false, users who have already synced to this service and have a sync ID will still able to get and update their syncs. | `true`
`status.message` | This message will be displayed in the service status panel of the client app when using this xBrowserSync service. Ideally the message should be 130 characters or less. | (Empty string, no message set)
`status.online` | If set to true no clients will be able to connect to this service. | `true`
`tests.db` | Name of the MongoDB database to use for integration tests. | `xbrowsersynctest`
`tests.port` | Port to use for running tests. | `8081`
`throttle.maxRequests` | Max number of connections during `throttle.timeWindow` milliseconds before sending a 429 response. Set as `0` to disable. | `1000`
`throttle.timeWindow` | Amount of time (in milliseconds) before throttle counter is reset. | `300000` (5 mins)

### 5. Create log folder

Ensure that the path set in the `log.path` config value exists, and that the account node will be running as can write to that location.

### 6. Run xBrowserSync service

    $ node dist/api.js

## Building

If you've made code changes you can run a fresh build with the command:

    $ npm run build

## Testing

To run unit tests, run either of the following commands:

    $ npm run test
    $ npm run unittests

To run integration tests, you will need to create the test database first. Run the following commands in the mongo shell:

  (Replace `[dbname]` with your xBrowserSync database name and `[password]` with the xBrowserSync database user account password)

  ```
  use [dbname]test
  db.createUser({ user: "xbrowsersyncdb", pwd: "[password]", roles: ["readWrite"] })
  ```

You can then run the integration tests by running the following command:

    $ npm run integrationtests

## Upgrading from an earlier version

### <= v1.1.5

From v1.1.6, database users are created in the admin database. When upgrading from an earlier version you'll either need to drop the existing users in the xbrowsersync database and recreate them in the admin database, or simply add the following to your `config/settings.json` file:

  ```
  "db": {
    "authSource": "xbrowsersync"
  }
  ```

Config settings for logging has also changed so ensure you update your `config/settings.json` file if you have customised logging settings.

### <= v1.0.3

If you are curently running v1.0.3 (or earlier) of the xBrowserSync API, you will need to export existing syncs and delete the xBrowserSync database before upgrading.

To export existing syncs, run the following command:

  ```
  mongoexport --db xBrowserSync -c bookmarks --out /path/to/export/file
  ```

Then to delete the database, run the following commands in the mongo shell:

  ```
  use xBrowserSync
  db.dropAllUsers()
  db.dropDatabase()
  ```

Once you've upgraded and completed the installation steps below, you can import the syncs by running the following command:

  ```
  mongoimport --db xbrowsersync -c bookmarks --file /path/to/export/file
  ```

## VS Code

If you're using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you have the following launch configurations:

  1. Debug API: Will compile and debug the main API service.
  2. Debug docs: Will launch API home page in chrome and attach to debugger for debugging docs issues. 
  3. Run unit tests: Will run and debug all tests in `test/unit` folder.
  4. Run integration tests: Will debug all tests in `test/integration` folder.

Note: we recommend [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/) for running VSCode without Microsoft's proprietary binaries and telemetry/tracking.
